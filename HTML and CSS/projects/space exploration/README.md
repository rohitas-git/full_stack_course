## 🎯 The Problem & Solution

**The Problem:** Recruitment pages for space travel can feel sterile and boring.

**The Solution:** A high-impact landing page that uses immersive visuals (GIFs and high-res images) and futuristic typography to excite potential applicants.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Immersive Backgrounds:** Features a static "universe" background for the page and a dynamic GIF background for the hero section to create depth.
*   **Futuristic Typography:** Uses the "Orbitron" font to give the text a sci-fi feel.
*   **Call to Action:** A high-contrast "Apply" button that stands out against the dark background.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** Clear distinction between the main title, subtitle (spanning text), and legal terms.

## 🧠 Learnings

*   **Background Management:** Learned how to use `background-image` and `background-size: cover` to create full-screen visuals that don't distort.
*   **Text Readability:** Applied `text-shadow` to ensure white text remains readable against bright or complex backgrounds.
*   **Inline Styling:** Used a `<span>` with a custom class to style a specific word ("exploration") differently within a heading.
*   **Button Styling:** Removed default browser styles (`border: none`) to create a custom, modern button component.
