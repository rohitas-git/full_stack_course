/*
Span vs Div:

1. <span> is an inline element.
   - It does not start on a new line.
   - It only takes up as much width as necessary.
   - Used for small chunks of text or styling within a block.

2. <div> is a block-level element.
   - It starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.
   - Used for grouping larger sections of content.

Usage of span:
- To target a specific piece of text for styling (like color, font-weight) without breaking the flow of the paragraph.
