**A simple internal tool to count passengers for subway stations.**

**Status:** MVP Complete

## 🎯 The Problem & Solution

**The Problem:** Station attendants need to track how many people enter the subway, but manually counting or using a clicker doesn't easily let them save and review previous batches.

**The Solution:** A digital counter app that allows attendants to increment the count and "save" the entry, creating a running log of passenger groups.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Increment Count:** A large button to easily add passengers one by one.
*   **Save & Log:** A "Save" feature that logs the current count and resets the counter to 0.
*   **Visual History:** Displays a list of previous entries (e.g., "12 - 5 - 10") directly on the screen.
